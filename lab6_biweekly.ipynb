    "## Instrumental Variables (IV)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final lab illustrates how to conduct instrumental variables regression. IV, as you recall, is useful when you have some instrument causing your predictor variable. This instrument must be connected to the outcome only through through the predictor. IV then uses the instrument to predict the predictor/treatment variable (first stage) and then uses those predicted values to model the outcome (second stage). IV regression helps us because we are modeling the change in the predictor attributable to the instrument, and the instrument is independent from any other confounders. Let's illustrate how IV regression works using some simulated data."
