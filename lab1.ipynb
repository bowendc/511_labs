    "The pipe operator allows users to pass objects onto multiple functions without creating new variables or nesting functions. The original pipe is built in to the **tidyverse** packages (%>%) - this is known as the **magrittr** pipe, and you'll see many example codes online using it. It's great. However, starting in R version 4.1, base R includes a new pipe operator that will work throughout everything in R (|>). Let's look at the example below using **tidyverse**'s *summarize* function, which aggregates data in the ways specfied in the command. In this case, we're summarizing two variables (two separate measures of member ideology, coded so that more extreme ideology is higher) in the ABH.data dataset by asking R to calculate their means. \n"
