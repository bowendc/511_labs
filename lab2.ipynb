In the paper, the authors are retesting a previous finding that citizens had negative opinions about public services, compared to private services. Respondents were randomly assigned to receiving a cue about a public or private hospital, and then asked to evaluate the organization on several items. We'll use one: *q9*: \"The hospital acts in the interest of patients\", scored on a scale from 1 (doesn't fit) to 7 (fits very well)."

    "To create a table of descriptive statistics, we will use the *sumtable()* function of the **vtable** package. This is a clean, well-formatted table output that will give us a nice set of options for exporting, viewing, or saving the table. The *select()* function is part of **tidyverse** and will allow us to filter out some columns of data if we want. You could do this directly in the *sumtable()* function using the *vars* argument. Check out the *out* argument from the help file to see some other options. I'm using *out = \"return\"* so that the table will show up as output in the console, but the default settings will open up an html version in your web browser. You can also export to a csv file. "

    "## Recoding and generating new variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing variables and creating new variables can be done in both base R and using the tidyverse. I typically use the **tidyverse** function *mutate()* for recoding and generating new variables. To illustrate how *mutate* works, let's recode the age variable in the dataset. Notice a couple of items about the following code. First, if we want the changes to remain, we need to assign the output of the function to a new object, or overwrite the existing object by assigning it its same. I would strongly recommend assigning to a new object when recoding, like in the code below. Second, you can string together multiple calls to recode or create new variables inside the same *mutate* call, just string them together with a comma. Finally, to recode from interval data into categories, we'll use the *case_when* function. This function will build, so it matters which order you list the conditions. If you list something last that contradicts what you said earlier, then the earlier recode will be overwritten. The final line of the *case_when* statement takes all of the remaining values and codes them to missing data.\n",
