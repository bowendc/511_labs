    "Matching methods are designed to generate estimates of the ATE or (much more commonly) the ATT by balancing, pruning and weighting your data. Matching methods are data-greedy; they work best when you have lots of observations to choose from. Typically, treated observations (those participating in the policy) will be matched with untreated observations. The untreated observations are thus used to provide the counterfactual: what would have been the case for our treated observations if they had not been treated. Or that, at least, is the idea.\n",
