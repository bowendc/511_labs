    "# Lab 1: R and Tidyverse Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with R Scripts, Folders, and Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most computing that you may be used to in this age of cloud services and data centers, we will be storing our files locally on your personal computer (or using the campus computer lab if needed). That means we need to tell R where our necessary files and folders are located. It won't matter too much for most of our labs, but when you work on your own projects, you will need to become profecient with accessing many files and folders on your computer. In R and RStudio, there are two ways of doing this. First, you can set up an RStudio Project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- File &rarr; New Project\n",
    "- Choose a name for the project and folder location.^[I have a folder called \"labs\" located in the my main PUBG 511 folder. If you are primarily going to be using RStudio through the computer lab or the Virtual App, then place this folder in your H:\\ network space]\n",
    "- Now start a new script using the sheet with a plus sign icon from the toolbar or using the file menu. On the right side of your window, it should show the name of your project.\n",
    "- RStudio projects make it so you don't need to worry about setting a working directory - it is defined in the project. Just make sure all files written to or read by R are in the same folder or in a nested subfolder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, in any R script or R session, you can specify the working directory. The working directory is the location on your computer that R will search for files or folders. So, for example, I could tell R to set my working directory to \"/home/dan/Courses/PUBG_511/labs\" and then any file I refer to in the script can be referenced in relation to my /labs folder without me specifying the rest of the file path. \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r \n",
    "setwd(\"filepath\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for my work, I might say:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "setwd(\"/home/dan/Courses/PUBG_511/labs\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "and then to import a .csv file located in the `labs` folder, I could simply code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "data <- read_csv(\"./some_data_set.csv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that how your computer refers to files and folders differs depending on your operating system. On Unix-based systems (macOS, Linux), folders are organized by user like: \"/myname/\" or \"/home/name/\", and folders are separated by forward slashes (/). On Windows, files have drive names like \"C:\\\" and then folders are separated by backslashes (\\). **Note that R does not accept the backslash in filepaths. So you either need to replace the backslash with a forward slash or use two backslashes (\\\\) to include the filepath. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing and loading packages\n",
    "\n",
    "R is open-source, and, frankly, kinda stinks on its own.^[This is called base R. ] But there are many, many user-generated packages that improve R's functionality. We'll be using these packages all the time, especially a group of packages called [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/). \n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to install the package once and then you're good to go (until it needs updating). But you also need to load the package in every R session if you want to use those commands. "

    "\n",
    "R has various formats for datasets, typically called a data frame. for this lab, we will be using a dataset created by Meier, Johnson, and An for their paper \"Perceptual Bias and Public Programs: The Case of the United States and Hospital Care.\" The dataset is part of the replication file their [PAR paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/puar.13067). In the paper, the authors are retesting a previous finding that citizens had negative opinions about public services, compared to private services. Respondents were randomly assigned to receiving a cue about a public or private hospital, and then asked to evaluate the organization on several items. We'll use one: *q9*: \"The hospital acts in the interest of patients\", scored on a scale from 1 (doesn't fit) to 7 (fits very well). Dataverse repositories allow files to be downloaded in multiple formats: usually as a Stata file, an R workspace, or as a .csv or .tab delimited text file. If you were to place your files in the same folder that you have set as your project location or working directory, you would not need to specify working directories or complete file paths; your computer will already know were to look for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can load an Rdata workspace using the `load()` function. We can also import datasets saved in other formats like .csv or .dta files using various R packages. To open the Stata .dta file, here stored in JOP dataverse, we'll need to use functionality from the `read_dta()` function from the **haven** package.

Let's look at the example below using **tidyverse**'s *summarize* function, which aggregates data in the ways specfied in the command.

    "\n",
    "Changing variables and creating new variables can be done in both base R and using the tidyverse. I typically use the **tidyverse** function `mutate()` for recoding and generating new variables. To illustrate how `mutate` works, let's recode the age variable in the dataset. Notice a couple of items about the following code. First, if we want the changes to remain, we need to assign the output of the function to a new object, or overwrite the existing object by assigning it its same. I would strongly recommend assigning to a new object when recoding, like in the code below. Second, you can string together multiple calls to recode or create new variables inside the same `mutate` call, just string them together with a comma. Finally, to recode from interval data into categories, we'll use the `case_when()` function. This function will build, so it matters which order you list the conditions. If you list something last that contradicts what you said earlier, then the earlier recode will be overwritten. The final line of the `case_when` statement takes all of the remaining values and codes them to missing data.\n",
